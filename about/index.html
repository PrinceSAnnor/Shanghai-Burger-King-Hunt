		<p>Food Chain of Thoughts is a project motivated by the developer's frustrations after eating fast food for a week. It recounts the developer's thoughts as he slowly traversed through traffic under a tunnel in Shanghai metropolis en route to a class trip organized by New York University Abu Dhabi during the annual January Term semester. The developer recounts his excitement about finding fast food in his early days at Shanghai and how he felt now after a week-long fast food spree. He first recollects his experience at a vegetarian restaurant during his first week and culminates the story with his visit to a halal restaurant which gives the story a blissful ending. The goals of this website are to provide a rich view into the experience of the developer during his three week stay in Shanghai, what his challenges were and to leave an unanswered question about the developerâ€™s next steps in considering cuisines. This site is also insightful because it provides a rich directive on the food choices in Shanghai and how to get to one from the Tong Mao Hotel.</p>
		<p>This project was built with p5.js [1], and JQuery [2] which are both javascript libraries. The images were loaded into two dimensional arrays and the text in a one dimensional array and displayed using algorithms developed by the developer unto an HTML canvas. All animations on the page were built from scratch using the libraries above and by manipulating objects with mathematics. However, the last firework was built by Daniel Shiffman of NYU ITP[3] at [4]. The major problem faced in this project was make it scalable to other devices, so that it appears the same on other devices. Therefore, the next steps are to further study p5.js and to tweak the program to appear similar on other devices and web browsers.</p>
